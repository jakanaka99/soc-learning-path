# SOC Learning Path

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning journey!  
This repository documents how I’m learning Security Operations Center (SOC) concepts and hands-on skills from **LetsDefend** and other online platforms.

## 🧠 My Learning Approach

I learn by:
1. **Exploring** – I first research each concept or tool on my own (e.g., SIEM, EDR, SOAR).  
2. **Practicing** – I complete hands-on labs to understand how it works in real-world SOC scenarios.  
3. **Facing Issues** – Whenever I get stuck (errors, confusion, or setup issues), I dig deeper, research the root cause, and document what I discovered.  
4. **Documenting** – I summarize key takeaways, what worked, what didn’t, and how I solved problems.  

This method helps me *think like an analyst* — learning not just what to do, but **why** things happen.
