# SOC Learning Path 🚀

Welcome to my SOC & Cybersecurity learning journey.  
This repository documents my hands-on experience, notes, and progress from courses and labs completed on **LetsDefend** and other training platforms.

Each folder represents a specific topic, course, or investigation I’ve completed as part of building my SOC analyst skillset.

## 🧾 How I Document Labs

Each lab or topic follows a consistent structure to reflect real SOC documentation standards:

### **1. Overview**  
A summary of the scenario, objectives, and what I am expected to analyze or detect.

### **2. Topics / Steps Covered**  
Commands used, tools involved, reasoning behind decisions, and the complete investigation workflow.

### **3. Findings**  
Key indicators of compromise, suspicious behaviors, artifacts, evidence, and conclusions from the analysis.

### **4. Conclusion**  
Lessons learned, remediation recommendations, and how the findings tie into real-world SOC operations.

## 🧠 Goal

To build a strong foundation in SOC analysis, incident response, log analysis, and threat detection through continuous hands-on learning and structured documentation.
