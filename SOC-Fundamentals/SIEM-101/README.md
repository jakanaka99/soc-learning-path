# 🧠 SIEM 101 — Useful Notes (Simple & Complete)

> This section is part of my **SOC learning journey** on [LetsDefend.io](https://letsdefend.io).

---

## 📘 Overview

This chapter covers the **fundamentals of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** — a core tool in any **Security Operations Center (SOC)**.  

The main goal was to understand how SIEM platforms **collect, aggregate, and analyze logs** from multiple systems to help identify potential security threats in real-time.  

It introduces essential SIEM components such as **log collection, parsing, normalization, alerting, and data storage** — foundational concepts for every SOC analyst.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- What a SIEM is and why it’s important in cybersecurity  
- How logs are collected from multiple sources (servers, firewalls, endpoints, applications)  
- The process of **aggregation, parsing, and normalization**  
- The purpose of **alerting** and how SOC analysts triage alerts  
- Common **SIEM use cases** for identifying attacks or policy violations  

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- **Centralized Visibility:** SIEM consolidates logs from across an organization, giving analysts a single point to monitor security events.  
- **Normalization Matters:** Converting logs into a consistent format makes it easier to search, correlate, and analyze security data.  
- **Alerting in Action:** SIEM generates alerts based on rules or correlations — helping analysts focus on suspicious patterns or behaviors.  
- **Efficient Triage:** Investigating alerts efficiently involves checking context, verifying sources, and identifying false positives.  
- **Detection & Response:** A well-tuned SIEM improves detection speed and strengthens the organization’s ability to respond to incidents.
