# 🚨 Incident Management 101

This section is part of my SOC learning journey on [LetsDefend.io](https://letsdefend.io).

---

## 📘 Overview

This chapter covers the fundamentals of **Incident Management** — how a SOC handles security problems from detection to resolution to keep systems safe.

The main goal was to understand how incidents are identified, analyzed, contained, and documented using structured processes within a SOC.

It introduces key concepts such as **incidents, events, alerts, false positives, true positives, false negatives, containment, post-incident review, and playbooks** — foundational knowledge for every SOC analyst.
